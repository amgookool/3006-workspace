| Pin Number | Pin Name | Alternate Name | Normally used for                                | Alternate Purpose                                                     |
|------------|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Ground   | -              | Connected to the ground circuit                  | -                                                                     |
| 2          | TX       | GPIO-1         | Connected to the RX pin of the serial programmer | Can act as a General Purpose Input/Output pin when not used as TX     |
| 3          | GPIO-2   | -              | General Purpose Input/Output pin                 | -                                                                     |
| 4          | CH_EN    | -              | Chip Enable - Active High                        | -                                                                     |
| 5          | GPIO-0   | Flash          | General Purpose Input/Output Pin                 | Takes the module into serial programming when held low during startup |
| 6          | Reset    | -              | Resets the module                                | -                                                                     |
| 7          | RX       | GPIO-3         | General Purpose Input/Output Pin                 | Can act as a general purpose Input/Output pin when not used as RX     |
| 8          | Vcc      | -              | Connect to 3.3V only                             | -                                                                     |
