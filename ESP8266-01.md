| Pin Number | Pin Name | Alternate Name | Normally used for                                | Alternate Purpose                                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | Ground   | -              | Connected to the ground circuit                  | -                                                                     |
| 2          | TX       | GPIO-1         | Connected to the RX pin of the serial programmer | Can act as a General Purpose Input/Output pin when not used as TX     |
| 3          | GPIO-2   | -              | General Purpose Input/Output pin                 | -                                                                     |

| 7          | RX       | GPIO-3         | General Purpose Input/Output Pin                 | Can act as a general purpose Input/Output pin when not used as RX     |
| 8          | Vcc      | -              | Connect to 3.3V only                             | -                                                                     |

## Flashing the ESP8266-01

The ESP8266-01 has two modes:

- Bootloader mode : for flashing new firmware
- Normal Mode : executing the firmware.

The bootloader mode can be launcherd with the following configuration during the chip's reset/power-on state:
- CH_PD must be HIGH (1)
- GPIO-0 has to be LOW (0) during boot (can be HIGH once in bootloader mode.)

**Steps for Flashing the ESP8266**

1. Push and hold the reset and GPIO-0 button
1. Execute the command to begin the flashing process on your terminal
1. Release the "RESET" button which starts the board in bootloader mode.
1. Wait a few seconds before releasing the GPIO-0 button
1. Confirm flashing process when progress bar appears on terminal.
